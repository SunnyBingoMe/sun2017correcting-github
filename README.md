# Abstract
A huge amount of traffic data is archived which can be used in data mining especially supervised learning. However, it is not being fully used due to lack of accurate accident information (labels). In this study, we improve a Mahalanobis distance based algorithm to be able to handle differential data to estimate flow fluctuations and detect accidents and use it to support correcting and complementing accident information. The outlier detection algorithm provides accurate suggestions for accident occurring time, duration and direction. We also develop a system with interactive user interface to realize this procedure. There are three contributions for data handling. Firstly, we propose to use multi-metric traffic data instead of single metric for traffic outlier detection. Secondly, we present a practical method to organise traffic data and to evaluate the organisation for Mahalanobis distance. Thirdly, we describe a general method to modify Mahalanobis distance algorithms to be updatable.
